# nerves-utils

This project contains useful Erlang modules for working with nerves
projects. None of this is substantial enough to warrant its own project
yet, but until then, it needs a home to prevent a lot of copy/paste
between projects.

## mount

This file wraps calls to mount(2). It is useful for mounting, unmounting
and remounting filesystems.

## subprocess

This file contains utilities for dealing with OS processes. This includes
running processes, capturing their output and listing the active processes
(aka ps).
